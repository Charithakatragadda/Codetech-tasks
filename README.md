The first task is EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS,where i find descriptive statistics about the dataset and visualize my findings from the dataset.
They include heatmaps,histograms,timeseries plots,moving average model and detecting outliers using box plot.
conclusions:

EDA on the market dataset revealed no missing values and high correlations among price columns. Closing prices show near-normal distribution with slight skewness. Visible trends and seasonal patterns exist. Moving averages highlight long-term trends. Outliers may indicate significant market events or anomalies.
